 ## how I would collaborate with a teammate to improve or expand this task.
<br>
First, I would start by discussing the requirements, current implementation, and all possible areas for improvement. Then, I would work on a code review with my teammate to improve error handling, clean redundant code, and more.
<br>
If the project grows, I would also consider using a global state for better scalability as well as implementing more dependencies to enhance performance, improve data fetching, and enhance user experience.

## If I had more time
I would consider adding a backend database since the server is currently using memory storage which is not practical at all for a production project. I would also consider adding animations and improving UI responsiveness for different screen sizes. After that, I would implement unit testing to make sure that everything works as expected. I would also implement role based access by adding authentication and authorization so that each logged user can view all his superhero cards anytime and anywhere.
